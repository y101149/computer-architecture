In this program, we first load the contents from paragraph.txt.
It contains six sentence and some words.
Then we begin running the program.
We first store the words (include space and \n) to the memory started from 500
We then store the words to look up started at 400
We store the length of the words to look up at memory 28                            (0)
We then scan the words from memory at 500
Put the location of the first character of each word at location started from 1000  (1)
Put the location of the last character of each word at location started from 1100   (2)
Put the location of the row number of each word at location started from 1200
Put the location of the column character of each word at location started from 1300
Then we can know the length of each word from (1) and (2)                           (3)
We compare (0) and (3) if equal then it means the length is the same
and we compare the two words if not equal, we jump to next word
In the comparison of the two words, if any matched character, if they are different
We set the flag bit 1 located at memory 1
After scanning each words, we check the flag bit and determine whether to output
At last we output the row and column and the words we find.

Pseudocode

String wordToScan;
String words[100];
int length;
int templength;
int number;
int row[100];
int column[100];
int flag = 0;
read words from paragraph.txt
we then store the words to words[]
the row to row[] and the column to column[], and 
we know the number of words
input word to look up
length = wordToScan.length();
for(int i = 0;i < number; i++ ){
	if(length == words[i].length())
	{
		for(int j = 0; j < length; j++){
			if(words[i][j] != wordToScan[j])//may need to change in real java maybe tostring
				flag = 1;
				
		}
		if(flag == 0)
		{
			output row column and word
		}
		flag = 0;
	}
}
