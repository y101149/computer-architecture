AS INITIAL, WE FIRST STORE 3.5 AT MEMORY 2 AND WE STORE 6.25 AT MEMORY 1
LDFR R0 X0 0 2    WE FIRST LOAD R0 FROM MEMORY AT 2
LDFR R1 X0 0 2    WE THEN  LOAD R1 FROM MEMORY AT 2
FADD R0 X0 0 1    WE ADD: R0 = R0 + MEMORY AT 1
FSUB R1 X0 0 1    WE SUB: R1 = R1 - MEMORY AT 1
SO R0 WILL BE 6.25 + 3.5 = 9.75
SO R1 WILL BE 3.5 - 6.25 = -2.25
