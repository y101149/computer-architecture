input 20 numbers one by one in temp[20] put in memory 500--519
and input the good number in find put in memory 520
C version Pseudocode of program1
in my simulator all the instructions are store from memory[100], all the data are start from 500
memory before 100 are used to store temporary data, address from 11 to 31 are especially important
int differ = find - temp[0]
int m,n,a,b;
int s
if (differ < 0)
	m = -differ;
else
	m = differ;
n = temp[0];
int i = 0
for( i = 1; i < 20; i++)
{
    s = find - temp[i];
	if(s < 0)
		a = -s;
	else
		a = s;
	if(a - m < 0)
	{
		m = a;
		n = temp[i];
	}
}

printf("%d",n);
